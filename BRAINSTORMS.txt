    o	Scoring
      	Points are awarded for each enemy defeated
      	An increasing point multiplier is given for faster level completion speed
        •	Example:
          01:30 minutes
          1 minute = 60 points
          30 seconds = 30 points
          multiplier = 90
          (100 (completion) * (1/90)) * 100 = 111 points

          02:00 minutes
          2 minutes = 120 points
          0 seconds = 0
          multiplier = 120
          (100 (completion) * (1/120)) * 100 = 83 points
